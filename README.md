# BDI-Multi-Agents-Communication-Model

<<<<<<< HEAD

A simulation to detect and control fires in parks implemented as a model in the NetLogo platform.
The implemetation describes a suitable cooperation protocol using a proactive layer for each agent, modelled using an architecture related to BDI concepts and FIPA ACL style communication within the model.
