;;; File to be included in NetLogo Mutliagent Models
;;; BDI Architecture for NetLogo Models
;;; Includes belief revision procedures and Intentions Handling and Execution.
;;; Original Version for Netlogo 2 (2005) I. Sakellariou
;;; Adapted to NetLogo 4 (2008) I. Sakellariou

;;; Requirements
;;; All agents that modeled as "BDI" agent have two declared -own variables beliefs intentions.
;;; These are the variables to which all beliefs and intentions are recorded. So, in your model if there is a breed of turtles 
;;; which you desire to model as BDI, then you should have a BREED-own [beliefs intentions] declaration (along with any other 
;;; variables that you wish to include in your model. 
;;; MAKE SURE that when you create the variables you set their initial values to empty list ([]).
;;; YOU also must have ticks!! in your model (or timeout will not work).

;;;;;;;;;; BELIEFS
;; There is nothing magical about beliefs: they are simply items 
;; of a specific list. Check list processing in NetLogo. However
;; here are some usefull procedures. 

;;; creates a new belief. (does not stores it in belief memory).
to-report create-belief [b-type content]
  report (list b-type content)
end 

;;; reports type of a belief.
to-report belief-type [bel]
  report first bel
end

;; reports the coontent of belief belief 
to-report belief-content [bel]
  report item 1 bel
end

;; Adding information to the beliefs structure
to add-belief [bel]
  if member? bel beliefs [stop]
  set beliefs fput bel beliefs 
end 
;; Removing a belief from the list of beliefs. 
to remove-belief [bel]
 set beliefs remove bel beliefs 
end 
 
;;; return true if a specific belief belong to the set of beliefs
to-report exists-belief [bel]
   ifelse member? bel beliefs [report true] [report false]
end

;;; Reports true if a belief in the form of ["b-type" etc etc etc ...] exist in beliefs list
to-report exist-beliefs-of-type [b-type]
  let blfs filter [first ? = b-type] beliefs
  ifelse empty? blfs [report false] [report true]
end

;;; Returns all beliefs of b-type in a list
to-report beliefs-of-type [b-type]
  report filter [first ? = b-type] beliefs
end

;;; Returns the first belief of a certain type and removes it
to-report get-belief [b-type]
  ifelse exist-beliefs-of-type b-type 
  [let bel first filter [first ? = b-type] beliefs
   remove-belief bel
   report bel
  ]
  [report false]
end

to-report read-first-belief-of-type [b-type]
   report first beliefs-of-type b-type
end 

to update-belief [bel]
   remove-belief read-first-belief-of-type belief-type bel
   add-belief bel
end

to execute-intentions
;;;locals [myInt]  ;; first intentions
  if empty? intentions [stop]

;;;; Intentions Structure Access Functions
;; returns the current intention of the agent
to-report current-intention
  report intention-name first intentions  
end 

;; Reports the full intention structure 
to-report get-intention
  report first intentions
end 

;; Returns the intetnion name (the executable)
to-report intention-name [intention]
  report item 0 intention
end

;; return the done-methods (arguments) of the intention. If it evaluates to true 
;; then the intention is removed. 
to-report intention-done [intention]
  report item 1 intention
end 

;; Removes a specific intention from the intention stack 
to remove-intention [intention]
  set intentions remove intention intentions
end 

;; Adds an intention in the intentions list. REMEMBER that intentions are 
;; stored in a STACK!
;; The first argument is the intention name that should be some executable procedure 
;; you encode in NetLogo. The second argument should be a REPORTER that when evaluates to 
;; true the intention is removed (either accomplished or dropped). 
;; BOTH ARGUMENTS HAVE TO BE STRINGS (see run/runresult primitive procedures in NetLogo)
to add-intention [name done]
  set intentions fput (list name done) intentions
